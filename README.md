Colors stimulates various regions of your kid's brain. They can improve their nervous system, heart functioning, release happy hormone and can even help in digestion. Likewise, shapes too have great impact on a human being. A circular shape triggers friendship and love, square forges strength and power and some shape power, happiness, rhythm, courage and so on.

"Colors and shapes" is an observe and learn activity for your toddler. Just by seeing the changing colors and shapes, the kids learn and grow.
